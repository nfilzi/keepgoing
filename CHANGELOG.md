- Update CHANGELOG 🤦‍♂️

## [0.2.0] - 2022-06-14

- Use `fork` to enable keepgoing to even restart blocking scripts on changes. This allows you to use keepgoing with scripts that start web servers or anything else that is blocking and keeps your script from exiting.

- Initial release of keepgoing, my first gem ever 🎉
